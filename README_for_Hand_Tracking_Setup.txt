For those of you who have an Oculus Quest and want to try out the game, you
need to enable hand tracking on your Quest.

To set that up:

1) Navigate to the settings tab
2) Click "Experimental Features"
3) Then toggle on Hand Tracking

You need the v12 update for the Quest, but you likely already have it.
